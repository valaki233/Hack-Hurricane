# AI-park

Amusement parks can be a wonderful time for a whole family. Thatâ€™s what most people would think but when you finally decide to shell out hundreds of dollars for a day of fun, reality kicks in quickly. Long queues, short rides, and a constant squash for the attractions can lead to a dreary visit. Motivated by personal experience we created AI-park that uses the power of Large Language models to give you the best possible route in a theme park.
